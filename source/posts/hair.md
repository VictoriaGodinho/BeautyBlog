Hair has always felt like my most expressive canvas. It’s where I test reinvention, whether it’s cutting bangs, changing the color, or simply letting it breathe. I love the small rituals around caring for it: the scent of conditioner, the feeling of combing through damp strands, the quiet patience of waiting for it to dry.
