Body care, to me, is about reclaiming softness. Applying lotion, exfoliating, or massaging oil into my skin isn’t about appearance — it’s about feeling human. It’s about recognizing my body as something to care for, not fix. These small acts of care make me feel grounded, comfortable, and confident. Real luxury is time spent on yourself.
