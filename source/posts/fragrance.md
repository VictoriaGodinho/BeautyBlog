Fragrance feels invisible yet deeply personal. I think of it as the soul of beauty, unseen, but emotionally vivid. Each scent I wear carries its own memory: a summer in the city, a person I used to love, a moment of calm before a big day. I love how perfume lingers, even after I’ve left a room — like a gentle echo of who I am that day.
