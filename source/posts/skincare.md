Skincare teaches me to listen, to notice how my skin reacts, what it needs, and when it feels tired. Cleansing, hydrating, and layering are less about vanity and more about paying attention. My favorite part is the pause... the quiet few minutes where Iâ€™m doing something entirely for myself. Skincare has become a small, everyday meditation.
