Makeup is the language I use when words feel too limiting. Some days it’s subtle and skin-like; others it’s vibrant, sharp, and loud. I love how a line of eyeliner or a red lip can completely alter how I carry myself; Not as a mask, but as a mood enhancer. It’s not about perfection; it’s about play. Each product is a pigment of emotion.
